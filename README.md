I Used java swing package for this project for adding GUI, and used the Jframe class.
in this project i added the basic logic which is similar to the brute force and came to my mind since it is a easy project so i particularly added all the winning and draw possibilities for this game in the winninggame() function.
i initialized a integer i and used the increment operator in every box so that if 9 moves are played then this game will result in a draw.
